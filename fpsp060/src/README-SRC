This is the a modified version of the original source code from
Motorola for the 68060 processor support code, providing emulation for
rarely used m68k instructions not implemented in the 68060 silicon.

The code provided here was changed to assemble out of the box using
the GNU assembler, and it is being included in order to comply with
the GNU General Public License. Original sources (only usable by
sun assembler) can be found in the "orig" directory.

You don't need to actually assemble these files in order to compile a
working m68k kernel, the precompiled .sa files in the parent directory
are sufficient.
